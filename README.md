# ModularCode
ChatGPT for Non-Developers: An Intuitive Framework for Complex Application Development

Description
Welcome to the ChatGPT for Non-Developers project! This user-friendly framework empowers non-programmers to develop complex software applications using a simple framework, plain english, and chatGPT. Leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to transform your natural language instructions into functional Python code. Go beyond basic scripting, and explore the world of software development, all guided by the power of artificial intelligence. No previous programming knowledge? No problem.

How does this work? 
By understanding and following these simplified rules, you'll grasp the core principles of ModularCode and be able to utilize its benefits for developing complex applications efficiently:
1. Modular Structure: Divide your code into smaller, self-contained components called Feature Files.
2. Master File: The central control point containing the main logic of your application.
3. Feature Files: Implement specific functionalities or modules of your application.
4. Modularity: Easily add, modify, or remove Feature Files without affecting the rest of the code.
5. Clear Separation: Each Feature File has a clear responsibility and encapsulates related logic.
6. Logging Integration: Integrate logging for error tracking and debugging.
7. Error Handling: Gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages.
9. Documentation: Document your code for better readability and understanding.

 Example: 
  You can think about each of the boxes below as a seperate file. 
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Website Application                 │
│    (Master File - main logic)             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼

 General Prompt to give to ChatGPT:
Prompt: "You are a developer using the ModularCode framework to develop a software project. You want to create a web application for an online store. Follow the principles of ModularCode and design the project accordingly. Divide the code into modular Feature Files, implement clear separation of responsibilities, integrate logging for error tracking, handle errors gracefully, and ensure thorough documentation. Additionally, incorporate version control for managing different versions of the codebase. Please generate the Python code for this project."

By providing this prompt to ChatGPT, you explicitly instruct it to adhere to the principles of ModularCode and follow the rules you approved. It ensures that the generated code will be structured using modular components, have clear separation of responsibilities, include logging for error tracking, implement proper error handling, document the codebase effectively, and utilize version control for managing different versions of the project.
